# Memory-card-Game

<h2>About</h2>
Welcome to the Memory Card Game, a fun and challenging game that tests your memory and concentration! The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be played in a web browser.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
The game is simple: click on a card to flip it over and reveal its symbol. Try to find the matching symbol by clicking on another card. If the symbols match, the cards will stay flipped over. If they don't match, the cards will flip back over. The goal is to find all the matching pairs in as few moves as possible.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3><li>Timer</h3>
 The game tracks how long it takes you to complete the game. The timer starts when you click the "Start Game" button and stops when you've found all the matching pairs.

<h3><li>Move Counter</h3>
The game keeps track of how many moves you've made. Each time you click on a card, the move counter increments.

<h3><li>Stop Game</h3>
You can stop the game at any time and start again from the beginning. Clicking the "Stop Game" button will reset the timer and move counter, and shuffle the cards.

<h3><li>Start Game</h3>
Click the "Start Game" button to begin a new game. This will reset the timer and move counter, and shuffle the cards.

<h3><li>Card Grid</h3>
The game uses a 4x4 grid to display the cards. Each card has a symbol on the back, and when you click on a card, it flips over to reveal the symbol.

<h3><li>Card Matching</h3>
When you click on a card, it flips over to reveal its symbol. If you click on another card with the same symbol, the cards will stay flipped over. If the symbols don't match, the cards will flip back over.

<h3><li>Winning the Game</h3>
The game is won when you've found all the matching pairs. When you've won, a congratulatory message will appear, and you can start a new game by clicking the "Start Game" button.
